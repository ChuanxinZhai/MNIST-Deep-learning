# MNIST-Deep-Learning

Use the Pytorch software and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) framework for handwritten digits classification. Image classification aims to predict the category of object in an image (one image can only have one object in it). It has attracted much attention within the computer vision community in recent years as an important component for computer vision applications, such as self-driving vehicles, video surveillance and robotics. It is also the foundation of other computer vision research topics, such as object detection and instance segmentation. CNN is a framework with both feature extraction and classification using deep convolutional neural network. A typical CNN pipeline is shown below.

The Dataset we will use is MNIST dataset, it has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The dataset is originally available on Yann Lecunâ€™s website. The followings are examples of handwritten digits in MNIST dataset.

#### Task1

Describe the 2 key components in the CNN framework: the convolutional kernel and the loss functions used in the framework.

#### Task2

Train (or fine-tune) and test the framework on MNIST and report the final accuracy performance that you have achieved. Please also report some well classified and misclassified images by including the images and corresponding classification confidence value.

#### Task3

Propose your own method to further improve the classification performance or reduce the model size. You need also compare different methods with the performance you obtained and explain why. The final classification accuracy is not the most important part, you may better refer to some latest published papers and code these state of the art methods to improve the performance.
